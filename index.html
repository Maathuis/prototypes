    <h2>About the Project</h2><br>
    <p>The explainability of outcomes and processes in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is a crucial factor in fostering trust among consumers and society, especially within the financial sector. In this project, we are developing tools to translate the results of complex AI systems into understandable explanations for internal users, such as risk underwriters and claims handlers. This is important because these employees interact with customers and must be able to provide clear explanations, for example, when a customer's insurance claim is denied due to being flagged as fraudulent by an AI system.</p><br>

    <h3>Objective</h3><br>
    <p>The project aims to make a tangible contribution to the implementation of effective and human-centered AI applications by creating tools that provide internal users with better insights into how these systems work and the reasoning behind their outcomes.</p><br>

    <h3>Results</h3><br>
    <p>The project will deliver guidelines (in the form of tools and instruments) to assist in generating, communicating, and evaluating explanations. The primary target audience for these guidelines includes designers and developers of AI and explainable AI (XAI) systems.</p>
